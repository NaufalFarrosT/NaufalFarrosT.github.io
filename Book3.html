							<h1>What is Healthy Activites?</h1>
							<p>
							WHO defines physical activity as any bodily movement produced by skeletal muscles that requires energy expenditure - including activities undertaken while working, playing, carrying out household chores, travelling, and engaging in recreational pursuits.
							</p>

							<p>
								The term "physical activity" should not be confused with "exercise", which is a subcategory of physical activity that is planned, structured, repetitive, and aims to improve or maintain one or more components of physical fitness. Beyond exercise, any other physical activity that is done during leisure time, for transport to get to and from places, or as part of a person’s work, has a health benefit. Further, both moderate- and vigorous-intensity physical activity improve health.

                            <br>2. Physical activity of amounts greater than 60 minutes daily will provide additional health benefits.
                            <br>3. Should include activities that strengthen muscle and bone, at least 3 times per week.
                            </p>
